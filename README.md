The purpose of this website is three-fold:
1. To be able to generate random romance novel covers.
2. Save book covers that are especially liked.
3. To be able to create your own romance novel covers.

## Description

Our website is designed for romance novel enthusiasts. Our site allows users to browse an extensive array of randomly generated romance novel covers. Once a user comes across a cover they want to save, our website provides the ability to save those covers for later viewing. Finally, our website also provides our users with the ability make their own romance novel covers. All they need to do is provide a link to an image, provide a title, and two descriptors about their book, and click the 'Make My Cover' button and our website will generate their new cover for their viewing pleasure. These custom covers can also be saved, and their individual components will also be used to create new covers for as long as the webpage is not refreshed.
